Project: Bird Hunt Game (GitHub Link)

    -Developed a bird hunting game using SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) in C++.
    -Implemented game elements including a player-controlled scope, moving birds, and a scoring system.
    -Utilized object-oriented programming principles for modular code and efficient game design.
    -Integrated background music, gunshot sound effects, and bird chirping to enhance the gaming experience.
    -Implemented features like time countdown, score tracking, and game over conditions for a complete gameplay loop.
    -Used randomization for bird movement patterns, adding variability to the game.
    -Employed SFML's graphics and audio modules for rendering visuals and playing sounds.
    -Demonstrated creativity in bird animation and shooting mechanics for an engaging user experience.
    -Provided visual and auditory feedback to the player, enhancing immersion and gameplay enjoyment.
